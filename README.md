I'm glad you are interested in me! Here are some points that highlight my diverse background and that may be of interest to you. You might be interested as well in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/one-scott-smith/).

## The Technical Highlights

- Currently, I am a student (🌱) of [**App Academy**](https://www.appacademy.io/) (on GitHub [@appacademy](https://github.com/appacademy)), working (🔭) to become a **full-stack software engineer**. So far a short list of relevant things learned are:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Use of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
   - Javascript
   - Unit Testing (with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/))
- I have a past background in (primarily) self-taught **HTML** and **CSS** (currently still [ranking fairly high](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/52750/tag-rankings-fun) (put TagName = css and UserId = 0 for all user ranking; as of 9/2/12020 I was 30th) for answering CSS questions on Stack Overflow; my [**SO profile**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/369707/scotts))
- I also have some prior self-taught experience with **JavaScript** (including some libraries, like [MooTools](https://mootools.net/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)); but I'm learning much more through App Academy!
- I also have dabbled in some [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/) (mainly related to [**Wordpress**](https://wordpress.org/) sites)

## Some Educational Highlights

- I have a **Bachelor of Science in Fine and Applied Arts** from the University of Oregon (emphasis was drawing and painting; minor was architectural design)
- I have a **Master of Bible Exposition** and **Master of Divinity** from Pensacola Theological Seminary
- I have a **Ph.D. in Biblical Studies** from (now) Carolina University (was Piedmont International University at the time I graduated)

## Some Personal Highlights

- I am a **Christian** (💬 about my faith if you want to know more) and **Bible-scholar** (also have extensive rank on [Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/2070/scotts)).
- I am happily **married** (no children; looking into adoption after a/A graduation).
- I enjoy reading **speculative fiction** (primarily fantasy genre) books, and both fantasy and sci-fi movies.
- In today's world, you may want to know that I identify as **he/his/him** for my pronouns.
